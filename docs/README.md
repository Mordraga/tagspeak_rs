# tagspeak_rs
##Everything is a Packet
Thoughts, code, memory, inputs, emotions â€” all exist in modular [packet] form. This includes files, functions, commands, and even syntax rules themselves.

##ðŸ§  Syntax Structure
TagSpeak follows a simplified English-like grammar:

##ðŸ“š Subject â†’ Object â†’ Action
Each packet is modular and symbolic. Meaning is derived from tag type and position â€” not spacing or indentation.

##ðŸ“¦ Basic Format
[subject@value]>[verb@modifier]>[action]
ðŸ”¹ Example
[math@10+10]>[store@result]>[print]
"Do math with 10 + 10, store the result, then print it."

This reads naturally and operates modularly:

[math@10+10]: defines the source packet.
[store@result]: routes the output to memory.
[print]: invokes a return/display function.
##ðŸ§° Syntax Primitives
Symbol	Meaning
[...]	Single packet
@	Denotes input to the packet
>	Output / routing between packets
:	Used for nested logic (optional)
->	Symbolic flow inside a packet (pure logic)
TagSpeak is intentionally visually parseable â€” for AIs, for humans, for scripts. Everything is a packet. Everything flows.
