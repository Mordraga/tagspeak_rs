[note@ Tagspeak is sandboxed by default to prevent accidental execution of harmful commands.]
[note@ Reason why is because tagspeak automatically searches for red.tgsk as a sentinel file in the current directory or any parent directory.]
[note@ If red.tgsk is found, then any code fails. Reason is because __init__.py is frustrating as hell so tagspeak skips that and makes everything a packet.]
[note@ Yellow packets are for human interaction, so nothing risky executes without user consent.]
[note@ If you want to run shell commands, you must wrap them in a yellow packet.]
[note@ You can bypass yellow packets by setting the environment variable TAGSPEAk_Allow_EXEC=1 in tagspeak.toml]
[note@ See exec.tgsk for an example of using exec without yellow packets.]
[note@ See yellow_exec.tgsk for an example of using yellow packets with exec.]
[note@ See yellow_exec_sugar.tgsk for an example of using yellow packets with exec sugar syntax.]
